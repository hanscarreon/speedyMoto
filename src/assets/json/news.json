            "desc":"After a dramatic, at times chaotic but always entertaining French GP, it‚Äôs time for the paddock to saddle up and head for the very different MotorLand Aragon. An outpost of speed in rural Teruel, the backdrop is a very different one to that of Le Mans ‚Äì and so is the track. With Marc Marquez (Repsol Honda Team), Dani Pedrosa, Jorge Lorenzo and Casey Stoner the only riders to have won at the venue, we‚Äôll have a new rider on the top step. But will it be a new winner in 2020? Or a first timer? We‚Äôre about to find out‚Ä¶",

            "desc":"Three things of note jump out after a three-HONOS Superbike race weekend at Indianapolis Motor Speedway: for starters, Italian Lorenzo Zanetti ended a winless drought for Ducati in AMA Superbike racing that dated back to 2010. Then there was Bobby Fong‚Äôs arrival as a bonafide MotoAmerica Superbike star with a weekend that saw him win two races and finish second in the only one he didn‚Äôt win. And it all wrapped up with the bow on top being the fact that Cameron Beaubier emerged from a somewhat difficult weekend with a fifth MotoAmerica Superbike Championship in his back pocket. For the first time all season, Monster Energy Attack Performance Yamaha‚Äôs Beaubier wasn‚Äôt the dominant force at Indy. With the weight of trying to put the championship on ice in the penultimate round, Beaubier had some struggles. He crashed out of Saturday‚Äôs race one and it put a visible dent in his confidence for Sunday‚Äôs two races. Even with the pressure, he persevered and finished on the podium in both races ‚Äì third in race two and second in race three. With that, he takes an insurmountable 97-point lead to WeatherTech Raceway Laguna Seca in two weeks where he hopes to return to his winning ways in an attempt to match Josh Hayes‚Äô 16-win season from 2012.",
